# Architecture and Implementation Overview

## Two Services

The Ontology Manager is made of two servers/services:

1. A Postgres Database
1. A web backend made of:
    * A Nuxt app, using Apollo as GraphQL client
    * A Nuxt Server Middleware that is trifid-core, see [trifid](#trifid)
    * A Nuxt Server Middleware implemented as an Express API
        * This is where the forge-specific functionality (GitHub, GitLab, …) is implemented
        * Configurable via `nuxt.config.js`
    * A Nuxt Server Middleware serving a GraphQL API backed by Postgres, schema generated by introspecting the pg schema

## Trifid

The [Trifid](https://github.com/zazuko/trifid-core) middleware is used to allow ontology content dereferencing, meaning that if `http://your.editor.com/schema/SomeObject` is an IRI in your ontology, you will be able to get N-Triples via content negotiation: `curl http://your.editor.com/schema/SomeObject -H 'Accept: application/n-triples'`.

## Database Objects

### Proposals

* `thread.headline`: the PR title and proposal title used in proposals lists
    * Sample value: `Change property 'wheelCount'`
* `thread.iri`: the IRI of the object from which the proposal originated
    * Sample value: `http://example.com/schema/wheelCount`
* `thread.body`: the motivation for this proposal
    * Sample value: `wheelCount currently has no type although it should be an integer`
* `thread.thread_type`:
    * Value: `proposal`
* `thread.status`: a new proposal is always `open`, admins can then set it to one of: `resolved`, `rejected`, `hidden`
    * Sample value: `open`
* `thread.is_draft`: `TRUE` until the proposal author submits their proposal
    * Sample value: `FALSE`
* `thread.proposal_object`: the actual proposal content in a serialized format, cf. [`proposalSerializer`](https://github.com/zazuko/ontology-manager/blob/8097185ca9eabc34a70b9c78ec8c2c321abdee6a/plugins/libs/proposals.js#L114-L116) and [`proposalDeserializer`](https://github.com/zazuko/ontology-manager/blob/8097185ca9eabc34a70b9c78ec8c2c321abdee6a/plugins/libs/proposals.js#L118-L125)
* `thread.branch_name`:
    * Sample value: `2019-03-12T140521.151Z`

Proposals are handled by one of these two store modules depending on their type:

* [`store/class.js`](./store/class.js)
* [`store/prop.js`](./store/prop.js)

These store modules are responsible for loading a proposal from the DB, saving a proposal to the DB, etc.

### Threads

* A thread can either be a `discussion` or a `proposal`.
* A thread with `discussion` type is a conversation, messages belong to a thread.
